## Section 4: UI Basicis  

### Tree structure has 5 top-level node  

- Data Sources  
  - Shows the data in the case organized by drive layout and directories.  
  - Alows you to find specific files.  
    - ie. you explicitly want to see their Desktop folder.  
  - Collapsed by default  
- Views  
  - Shows files organized by metadata.  
  - Same data as in the "Data sources" area, just organized differently  
  - View by Type
    - Used this area to focus on files of a certain type, ie. Images, Documents, Executables  
  - Can organize by extension or by file signature (MIME Type)  
    - Extension filtering can be done immediately
    - file type filtering requires all files to be analyzed  
  - View by size  
    - use this area to find large files  
    - Examples: Encrypted volumes; virtual disks  
- Results  
  - shows the results fro the analysis ingest modules  
  - Has Lower-levels of organization  
    - Extracted content contains most  
    - Specialized ones are separated out.
- Tags  
  - Tags are shows what files and results have been tagged
- Reports  
  - Reports area shows the reports generated by the user or a modules

### Grouping by datasourse  

 You can choose to organize the tree by data sources. Default is grouping by top level data sources.  This makes it easier to focus on results for a specifice data source.  

 Can change the groups by:  

 1. Selecting the gear and changing it in settings
 2. Autopsy will prompt you when importing more than 5 data sources.  

---

### Table view  

 Default is 10,000 items shown.  
 Search by selecting any item and start typing.  
Many rows have 3 columns to give you a quick contexts about an item:  

1. First column: Score:  
    - Read Circle with white Explination mark:  
      - Item is notable: Hash hit; A notable tag was applied  
    - Yellow Circle with Triangle:  
      - Item is suspicious: A module marked it as "interesting"; A normal tag was applied  
2. Second Column: Comment:  
    - A yellow page is shown if the file has a comment.  
    - Either in the current case or a past case (Requires Central Repository)  
3. Third Column: Occurrences:  
    - How often this item has been seen in past cases (Requires Central Repository)  

Use Google translate folder names.  
Change to thumbnail views for images and videos.

### Content Viewer  

Hex Viewer  

- Displays file content in a basic hex editor  
- Always enabled if file has content  
- Can launch HxD if you need more powerful features  

Text tab  

- Text contain various sub viewers that are all related to to text.  
- Strings:  
  - Shows data that **could** be text in a given encoding.  
  - Can have false positives  
- Indexted Text:  
  - Shows what is in the keywork search index  
  - For supported file types, shows text after parsing structure.  
    - It knows about PDF versus DOC  
  - For unsupported file types, it shows strings.  
- Translation Tab:  
  - Uses Google or Bing translate (if configured)  
  - Translates the same text as shown in "Indexed Text"  

Application Tab  

- File type-specific viewer:  
  - Pictures  
  - Video  
  - SQLite  
  - HTML  
  - Registry  
  - Binary PList  
- Not a generic viewer like hex or raw text  

Message Tab

- Email-like display to show email and text messages  
- Header information and text, RTF and HTML messages.  

File Metadata  

- Shows metadata about a selected file  
- Similar to data to what is in table, ut easier to copy and paste  

Results  

- Shows all analysisi results performed on selected item.  
- Shows all data extracted from the selected item.  
- Data comes form the database blackboard.  

Annotations  

- Shows all examiner-specified data, such as tags and comments.  
- Shows data from both current and past cases (if Central Repository is enabled)  

Other Occurrences  

- Shows where else the selected item was seen.  
  - Occurrences on other data sources in same case  
  - Occurrences in past cases (if Central Repository is enabled)  

Defaults  

- When a new file is selected, can either:  
  1. Stay on same viewer  
  2. Choose the most relevant viewer  
      - Hex and strings are only relevant if nothing else is  
- To change, press the gear icon above the tree

### 3rd Party Content Viewer  

Video Triage - from Autopsy  

- Takes snapshots from a video  

Text Summarizer  

- Not part of open source package  
- Name finder and translator  
  - Users Basis Technology text analytics

---

### Other UI Components  

History Buttons to pull back out of a dead end lead.  

Progress bar at the bottom will show pop up all progresses and you can view or cancel them.  

Ingest inbox shows user what has ben found in background tasks.

Files searching by Metadata  

- Search database for files - **Not a Keyword Search**  

File Exporting, Viewing, etc  

- There are right click actions to:  
  - exort a copy of the file  
  - View  in an external viewer  
  - View in a new ("undocked") content viewer  

### Additional Interfaces  

- Nearly all data can be found in the main UI  
- there are some other more focused interfaces:  
  - Timeline: Displays events sorted by time  
  - Image Gallery: Displays pictures and vidwos goruped by folder  
  - communications: Displays accounts, messages, call logs, etc.  
- They can be opened from the tool bar

## Unit 5: Analyzing Data Sources  

### File Ingest Modules  

- data goes down a pipeline of modules
- Are run on every file in the data source
  - Unless 'Ingest Filters ' are applied  
- Many can run in parallel  
- `Official` Ingest Modulels  
  - Hash Lookup
  - Keyword Search
  - Embedded File Extraction
  - Recent Activity
  - Email

### Data Source Ingest Modules

- Not all data gets passed
- Anaylzes specific data  

### File Priotitization

- The ingest Manager runs in the background and schedules the files for analysis  
- Files go down the pipeline based onpriority:
  - User Folders
  - Program Files and other root folders
  - Windows folder
  - Unallocated space
- If a 2nd images is added while the 1st is still being ingested, the two are done in parallel
  - Files from image #2 could be highest priority  

  Data Source-level Modules  

  - Run on an entire data source  
  - Better for more focused analysis techniques:  
    - Query database for a set of files
    - Analyze the set of files  
    - Post results to blackboard  
  - Versus File-level Modules:  
    - Review every file to determine if it relevant
    - Analyze the relevant files  
    - Post results to blackboard  

### Running Ingest Modules  

- From the `Add Data Source` wizard  
- Right-click on a data source  
  - Modules may require configuration  
  - Basic options may exist when enabling module:  
  - More detailed confguration from `Global Settings` or `Tool -> Options`  

### Unallocted Space  

- You can choose to analyze the uallocated space files
  - They go last  
  
### Ingest filters  

- Allow you to only allow certain types of files down the pipelines.  
  - Only .jpg and .png files
  - Only files in Desktop folder
- Useful for triage / preview situations.  
- You can make them in the "Options" panel.  

### Blackboard Artifacts

- Ingest Moduels will save their results as Blackboard Artificats  
- Artifacts have a type and one or more attributes.  
- Example types:  
  - Web Bookmark
  - Hash Hit
  - Encryption Detected
- Autopsy comes with many predefined types and modules can make their own
- Blackboard Attributes
  - Each artifact has one or more attributes
  - An attribute is a type and value pair
  - Examples for a Web Bookmark artifact:  
    - URL: http://www.autopsy.com
    - DATETIME: april 1, 2020
- Module can choose what attibutes they add to an artifact  

### Viewing Artifacts  

- Shwo in the tree under `Extracted Content`
- Shown in the `Results` content viewer  
- Included in reports
